**Disease Outbreak Prediction Using Time Series Analysis and Classification**

*Overview*

This project predicts disease outbreaks and classifies countries into low, moderate, and high-risk categories based on healthcare infrastructure and socio-economic factors. It uses time series forecasting methods like ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM, along with classification algorithms such as Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks to forecast outbreaks and assist in resource allocation.

**Installation**

Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies by following the requirements.txt file.

**Data Collection**

*Data is sourced from:*

WHO Disease Outbreak News and COVID-19 Dashboards for outbreak data.

Statista for healthcare-related parameters such as hospital bed density and ICU availability.

**Methods**

Time Series Forecasting: ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM

Classification: Random Forest, Decision Trees, Neural Networks

**Results**

The models effectively classify countries based on outbreak risk and support strategic healthcare planning.

**Conclusion**

This project showcases the power of predictive analytics in managing global health crises and supports pandemic preparedness and resource allocation.
